This file contains a Python code for a autonomous Maze solving bot wihich will be integrated with arduino,
This code will be improved later for whole DFS search maze solving algorithm, but for now it conl detects the color and decrypts the barcodes and accordingly instructs arduino to run or stop the bot.
Also the commands which will instruct the arduino are commented for direct running and debuggibg purpose only.
